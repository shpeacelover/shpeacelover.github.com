听到John Lennon的“Oh my love”， 歌词还有曲调给人一种非常空旷的额感觉。现在就把歌词摘抄如下。   
    
Oh my love for the first time in my life,   
my eyes are wide open.    

Oh my love for the first time in my life,    
my eyes can see.   

I see the wind, I see the trees, everything is clear in my heart.    

I see the clouds, I see the sky, everything is clear in our world.  

Oh my lover for the first time in my life, my mind is wide open.   

Oh my lover for the first time in my life, my mind can feel.    

I feel sorrow, I feel dreams, everything is clear in my heart.    

I feel life, I feel love, everything is clear in our world.
