1. if there is a line and it is in normal mode, like "hello, everyone, this is steven sun". now if you position your cursor on the "s" of "steven sun" and then type "c2w", you will enter into the "insert mode" and will be prompted to enter some text.

2. use dap to delete a paragraph, use daw to  delete a  word, use dal to delete a  single character;

3. we can type :h operator to find those information about operators in vim.

4. an action is composed from an operator followed by a motion.
