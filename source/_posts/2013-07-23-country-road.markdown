Almost heaven, my hometown

To me as a child

Boundless  farmland

Smooth brook

Life is old there

Older than the trees

Younger than the mountains

Growin' like a breeze

Country Roads, take me home

To the place I belong

Like I never go beyond

Being innocent and having fun


(This is one I modified from John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads" to reminisce my long passed childhood.)
