Almost heaven, my hometown          

To me as a child        

Boundless  farmland         

Smooth brook    

Life is old there     

Older than the trees    

Younger than the mountains    

Growin' like a breeze     

Country Roads, take me home    

To the place I belong   

Like I never go beyond   

Being innocent and having fun     


(This is one I modified from John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads" to reminisce my long passed childhood.)
